### thoughts on writing graph "languages"

statefulness or not

custom ui

include computations within this

break up front end part and evaluation

evaluate dag data-structure
multiple execution programs for different paradigms

### use cases
mods
pure data/maxmsp (real time)
using for making combos of generative ai models
	- take a long time
	- progress bars in nodes
	- types to let you know if the program makes sense

broadcasting
types

### projects
mods pcb milling 
	- drive machine

real-time?
polling vs events

staleness?

serialization of types
